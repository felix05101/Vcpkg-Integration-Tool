# Vcpkg-Integration-Tool
This tool is designed to automate the process of setting up Vcpkg and integrating it with Visual Studio on a Windows system. It checks for the presence of Git and Vcpkg, installs them if necessary, and then integrates Vcpkg with Visual Studio. Additionally, it provides a command-line interface for installing and removing libraries using Vcpkg.
